# E-Bike Library

In partnership with [Wheel Simple](https://itswheelsimple.com/), `RVA E-Bikes!` is hosting an e-bike library. You can borrow an e-bike for up to 2 weeks from the library, to try out an e-bike for yourself!

We currently have two e-bikes available:

### How it works
- Anyone can borrow one (though we reserve the right to refuse to allow a check out for any reason). Borrows are up to two weeks - and completely free!
- You will be required to sign the [following waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4k8Agirku9Uu-0BwrA9dlE09qTCvKvaEII4W3eyC_Y/edit?usp=sharing) when checking out a bike from the shop. We will also take a photocopy of a photo ID (any photo ID will do)
