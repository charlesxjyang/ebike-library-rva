# RVA E-Bikes!

Welcome to `RVA E-Bikes`! We are a non-profit based in Richmond VA that aims to promote adoption of electric bikes. E-Bikes are [better for our climate, make our streets safer for our kids](https://charlesyang.substack.com/p/chartbook-electric-bikes-as-a-climate), and provide a more joyful way to get around our wonderful RVA!

The RVA E-Bikes! program is run by me, [Charles Yang](https://charlesxjyang.github.io/). I'm a born and raised Richmonder and I also started [RVA YIMBY](https://www.rvayimby.org/), a grassroots housing advocacy group.

We welcome [donations and volunteers](/support) if
you'd like to support our mission and help cover our costs.
