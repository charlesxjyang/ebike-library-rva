# What is this?

E-bikes can be a great alternative to driving, but they can also be a significant financial investment. We're loaning out e-bikes for up to a week so that community members can try commuting to work and running errands, and decide whether an e-bike is right for them.

This is a lending library and not a rental service, so there's no charge for borrowing the e-bikes. But if you'd like to make a small donation to help with maintenance or add mores e-bikes to the library, we'd appreciate it! We also use referrals to buy e-bikes and accessories from [Rad Power Bikes](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/)‚Äîuse our [referral code](http://rwrd.io/mt2dtbd?c) to save $50.

# What even is an e-bike? Why would I want one?

An e-bike is basically a standard bicycle with an electric motor. The motor engages as you pedal, and you can adjust the level of pedal assist to get more or less help from the e-bike. Some e-bikes, including our loaner, also have a throttle that you can use to activate the motor without pedaling.

Using an e-bike instead of a car can save you money: even high-end e-bikes are much cheaper than a car, and you won‚Äôt have to pay for gas or parking. Commuting with an e-bike instead of a car is also a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Plus, it's fun!

# How do I sign up?

Contact us at hi@ebikelibrarycville.org to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike, or to ask questions. You can also see current reservations on [our e-bikes](#our-e-bikes) below. You can borrow an e-bike for up to a week at a time. Then when you're done, tell your friends to get in touch and borrow an e-bike!

# Eligibility

* We really don't want our e-bikes to get stolen, so you should be able to store one indoors at home, and have a secure place to lock it up (ideally also indoors) if you‚Äôre commuting to work or to school. We'll provide a lock and show you how to use it. We also use a tracker to help prevent the e-bikes from being stolen, but we'll only use it if  an e-bike goes missing.
* You should be comfortable with the height and weight recommendations for [our e-bikes](#our-e-bikes). We're hoping to find e-bikes that fit a wider range of rider in the future. E-bikes are generally heavier than standard bicycles, so you might not want to carry them up or down stairs.
* You should be comfortable riding a standard bicycle and familiar with local bicycling rules. If you're planning to commute on the e-bike, you should map out a route that you‚Äôll feel safe on. Unfortunately, some roads in the area aren‚Äôt very bike-friendly.
