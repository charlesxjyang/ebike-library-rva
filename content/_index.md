# What is this?

E-bikes can be a great alternative to driving, but they can also be a significant financial investment. We're loaning out an e-bike (and hopefully eventually multiple e-bikes) for up to a week so that community members can try commuting to work and running errands, and decide whether an e-bike is right for them.

This is a lending library and not a rental service, so there's no charge for borrowing the e-bike. But if you'd like to make a small donation to help with maintenance or add another e-bike to the library, we'd appreciate it!

# What even is an e-bike? Why would I want one?

An e-bike is basically a standard bicycle with an electric motor. The motor engages as you pedal, and you can adjust the level of pedal assist to get more or less help from the e-bike. Some e-bikes, including our loaner, also have a throttle that you can use to activate the motor without pedaling.

Using an e-bike instead of a car can save you money: even high-end e-bikes are much cheaper than a car, and you won’t have to pay for gas or parking. Commuting with an e-bike instead of a car is also a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Plus, it's fun!

# How do I sign up?

# Eligibility

* We really don't want the e-bike to get stolen, so you should be able to store it indoors at home, and have a secure place to lock it up (ideally also indoors) if you’re commuting to work or to school. We'll provide a lock and show you how to use it. We also use a tracker to help prevent the e-bike from being stolen, but we'll only use it if the e-bike goes missing.
* Our loaner e-bike, a [RadRunner Plus](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrunner-plus-electric-utility-bike), fits riders 4'11" to 6'2" and carries up to 300 lb. It weighs about 75 lb, so you might not want to carry it up or down stairs.
* You should be comfortable riding a standard bicycle and familiar with local bicycling rules. If you're planning to commute on the e-bike, you should map out a route that you’ll feel safe on. Unfortunately, some roads in the area aren’t very bike-friendly.
