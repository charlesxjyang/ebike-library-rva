# Curious about e-bikes? Try one from the Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library!

E-bikes are a great way to get around Charlottesville. But there are
many brands and styles to choose from, and because many e-bikes are sold
online, it can be a challenge to try an e-bike before buying one. The
Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library is a free service that lends out
e-bikes for up to a week. You can experience your daily commute on an
e-bike and learn which style of e-bike works best for you. [Sign
up](https://forms.gle/ZykVSUUp2KPBHxfv5) to borrow an e-bike or [contact
us](mailto:hi@ebikelibrarycville.org) with any questions.

### How it works:
* Contact us to let us know which e-bike(s) you'd like to try.
* We'll get in touch to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike.
* Visit the library in Fifeville to pick up an e-bike. If you haven't
    ridden an e-bike before, expect this to take 15-30 minutes, or
    longer if you want to try more than one e-bike.
* Enjoy e-biking for up to a week, then bring the e-bike back to the
    library.
* You can borrow an e-bike more than once, or borrow multiple e-bikes.

To be eligible, you must be 18 or older, and have a secure place to
store an e-bike at home, and at work or school if you plan to commute.
You should also be comfortable riding a standard bicycle before trying
an e-bike.
