# Why e-bikes?

E-bikes are much like standard bicycles, but use an electric pedal assist system
to power the bike as you pedal. E-bikes can be a great alternative to
driving for short trips, and you don't have to worry about paying for
gas or parking. And they're family-friendly: cargo e-bikes can carry a
week's worth of groceries or a few kids.

The Charlottesville E-bike Lending Library loans out e-bikes for up to a
week so that you can get real-life experience on an e-bike
and decide whether e-bikes are right for you. You can test out your
commute to work or school, compare different routes, and even take a
friend or kid along for a ride‚Äîalthough kids love e-bikes and might not
be willing to give them up!

# How much does it cost?

Nothing! This is a lending library and not a rental service, so there's no charge for borrowing our e-bikes. But if you'd like to make a small donation to help with maintenance or add mores e-bikes to the library, we'd appreciate it!

We also have referral codes for some popular e-bike makers. If you buy one of
those e-bikes and use our code, you'll save money on the e-bike, and we'll
get a coupon or gift card, which we'll either give to you or pass on to
another local e-bike buyer‚Äîyour choice.

# But I'm not in shape!

No problem! Our e-bikes are designed for commuters and parents, so you
don't have to be a dedicated cyclist to ride them. The e-bikes we loan
out have step-through frames, so you don't have to swing your leg over
the seat; wide tires for stability; and, of course, electric
pedal-assist, so you can keep up with car traffic without breaking a
sweat.

We're also happy to help you find a safe route or secure bike parking.

# How do I sign up?

Contact us at hi@ebikelibrarycville.org to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike, or to ask questions. You can also see current reservations on [our e-bikes](#our-e-bikes) below. You can borrow an e-bike for up to a week at a time. Then when you're done, tell your friends to get in touch and borrow an e-bike!

# Eligibility

* We really don't want our e-bikes to get stolen, so you should be able to store one indoors at home, and have a secure place to lock it up (ideally also indoors) if you‚Äôre commuting to work or to school. We'll provide a lock and show you how to use it. We also use a tracker to help prevent the e-bikes from being stolen, but we'll only use it if an e-bike goes missing.
* You should be comfortable with the height and weight recommendations for [our e-bikes](#our-e-bikes). We're hoping to find e-bikes that fit a wider range of rider in the future. E-bikes are generally heavier than standard bicycles, so you might not want to carry them up or down stairs.
* You should be comfortable riding a standard bicycle and familiar with local bicycling rules. If you're planning to commute on the e-bike, you should map out a route that you‚Äôll feel safe on. Unfortunately, some roads in the area aren‚Äôt very bike-friendly.
